A Project, The Revelutionary.

It's Me, astralgalaxia, i've designed a GPU (Graphics processing unit) that is fully powered through an arduino board and Some AI (Artificial Intelligence)
This GPU is still in its very early stages, But as of now it is going extremely well through it's testing stages, The production cost is expected to be very
Low, compared to the Price to performance which is as of now similar to that of a GT 730, although i am still updating it slowly to get more performance out
of it! Any questions are accepted on my discord @AstralGalaxia And donations are very appreciated To my Ko-fi!

-The Revolution, AstralGalaxia.
